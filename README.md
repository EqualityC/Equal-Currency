# Equal-Currency
Equality Coin is an ideal digital currency due to its practicality and vertical growth potential.
This token will be utilized at thousands of small businesses. Initially, Afro-Hispanic communities
will be targeted in order to cultivate a grass roots movement. Equality Coin redemption at
barbershops, corner stores, cigar lounges, etc., should drive investments and a sense of pride in ethnic neighborhoods. 
Whereas most coins are backed by speculation with little to no usability, Equality Coins are backed by 
the small businesses that accept them. Ideally, businesses will offer between 5% and 10% discounts on services or
products purchased Equality. In return, that discount will be placed in a wallet for the 
customer. The purpose of this savings account or "wallet" is to introduce the digital coin market to new 
investors, both strengthening the overall environment and increasing wealth simultaneously.
Equality Coin users will have the option of either cashing in their savings by selling them or 
redeeming them at businesses that accept Equality. Participating businesses will
be listed in an app where users can easily find stores or service providers that accept this token.
Equality will integrate GPS technology, allowing businesses in every state to coordinate the
savings program.  Equality Coin wallets can either be cashed in or transfered after 90 days of maturity.
